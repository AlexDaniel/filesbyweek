FilesByWeek
http://patrickmylund.com/projects/filesbyweek/

FilesByWeek is a Linux shell (bash) script that lets you check how many files
in a directory were created (or last modified) in a certain week of the year,
using Linux's find and date.

It was designed to count the number of emails received in a few Linux/Postfix
Maildirs every week (and thus excludes .Sent and any Courier/Dovecot IMAP files),
but can be used on any kind of folder.

Usage: ./filesbyweek <week> [dir]
